Because this tool isn't intended for actual use. (Only for educational purposes. There is no support for the tool, installation, etc.) If you would like to contribute, please feel free to create a pull request. 

I created it as a class because I intended to use a for loop on a profiles list if someone had multiple accounts that they wanted to scrape the subs on. 

If you are interested in furthering the support and or code please feel free to follow me on buy me a coffee in the sponsor links on the side. Patreon coming soon.
